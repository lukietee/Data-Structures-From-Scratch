**Data Structures From Scratch in C++**

By implementing data structures from scratch in C++, I was able to deepen my understanding of memory management, pointers, and algorithm efficiency. I was able to gain a better grasp of what goes on in the background, and was able to understand how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated at a low level.


The following data structures have been implemented from scratch, with more to come!

Binary Search Tree

Singly Linked List

Doubly Linked List

Circular Linked List

Hash Table
