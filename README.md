**Data Structures From Scratch in C++**

By implementing data structures from scratch in C++, I was able to deepen my understanding of memory management, pointers, and algorithm efficiency. I was able to gain a better grasp of what goes on in the background, and was able to understand how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated at a low level.


The following data structures have been implemented from scratch, with more to come!

Binary Search Tree

- Load Tree from File
- Insert TreeNode
- Count TreeNodes
- Find TreeNode
- Delete TreeNode
- Printing In Order Traversal
- Printing Pre Order Traversal
- Printing Post Order Traversal
- Count Leaves
- Find Height
- Find Width
- Print By Level
- Clear Tree

Singly Linked List

- Load Linked List from File
- Insert List Nodes in Order
- Find List Node
- Remove List Node

- Count List Nodes
- Print Linked List Recursively
- Print Linked List Backwards Recursively

Doubly Linked List

- Load Linked List from File
- Insert List Nodes in Order
- Find List Node

Circular Linked List

- Load Linked List from File
- Insert List Nodes in Order
- Find List Node
- Remove List Node
